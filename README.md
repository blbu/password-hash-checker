# password-hash-checker
Check if your password has been compromised, without giving away your password

1. Make sure you're on a computer you trust, don't run this where people can see you typing your password, etc..
2. Open the script `Test-PasswordHashCompromised.ps1` and read it, make sure it's not doing anything bad. Change the password to a password you want to check.
3. Open PowerShell where you have saved the file
4. Run the script `./Test-PasswordHashCompromised.ps1`
5. See what it says (based on when you read it back in step two)
